# 📧 Spam Email Detection using Machine Learning

This project builds a spam email detection system using 
Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning.

## 🚀 Features
- Text preprocessing and cleaning
- TF-IDF feature extraction
- Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes models
- Model evaluation using precision, recall, and F1-score
- Custom email testing

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, NumPy
- NLTK
- TF-IDF Vectorizer

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset contains labeled email messages as:
- 0 → Not Spam (Ham)
- 1 → Spam

## 🧪 How to Run

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sudhanshu-Roy/spam-detection-ml.git
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Run the notebooks in order

Result

The model achieves high spam recall, making it suitable
for real-world spam detection systems.
