# Spam Email Detection using Machine Learning

This project builds a spam email detection system using 
Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning.

## Features
- Text preprocessing and cleaning
- TF-IDF feature extraction
- Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes models
- Model evaluation using precision, recall, and F1-score
- Custom email testing

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, NumPy
- NLTK
- TF-IDF Vectorizer

## Dataset
The dataset contains Categorized email messages as:
- Ham
- Spam
- Following is the Bargraph of Category Distribution in Dataset

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sudhanshu-Roy/spam-detection-ml.git
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Run the notebooks in order

Result
